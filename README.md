# AVOK 
is a simple network scanning tool designed to help users identify open ports on target hosts.
It provides a quick and easy way to perform port scans on one or more hosts,
allowing users to assess the security posture of their network or identify potential vulnerabilities.

# Features:

   - **Port Scanning:** AVOK scans common TCP ports to check if they are open or closed on the specified target host(s).

   - **IP Address Resolution:** It resolves hostnames to IP addresses to ensure accurate scanning.

   - **Customizable Port Range:** Users can specify the range of ports to scan, providing flexibility based on their requirements.

   # Usage:

  __AVOK__ is intended for security professionals, network administrators, or anyone interested in monitoring the security of their network infrastructure. It can be used for various purposes, including:

  __Network Security Assessment:__ Identifying open ports can help assess the security posture of a network and identify potential entry points for attackers.

  __Vulnerability Detection:__ Open ports may indicate potential vulnerabilities in network services or configurations that need to be addressed.

  __Troubleshooting:__ It can be used to troubleshoot network connectivity issues by verifying if specific ports are accessible.

## Note:

  > While AVOK provides valuable information about open ports, it's essential to use it responsibly and ensure that you have proper authorization before scanning any network or system that you do not own or manage.

  > Additionally, AVOK's capabilities are limited to scanning TCP ports, and it does not perform comprehensive vulnerability assessments or exploit testing. For more advanced security testing, consider using specialized         tools and techniques.
